# chess-ai
 A Python-based Chess AI built using Pygame. This project features an AI opponent that utilizes a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, enhanced by various heuristic evaluations to simulate a challenging game of chess. The AI supports all standard chess moves, including castling and en passant, and can detect check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.
